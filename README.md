## Introduction
 Several samples show how to use the APIs of the Nearby Service. The project directory is as follows:
1. [NearbyStores](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyStores): The package contains an Android Studio project that provides a sample for Beacon Management.
2. [NearbyWifiShare](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyWifiShare): The package contains a project that demonstrates how to quickly integrate the Wi-Fi sharing function.
3. [NearbyIM](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyIM): The NearbyIM sample contains a project that demonstrates how to develop a nearby social networking app using Message APIs.
4. [NearbyGameSnake](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyGameSnake): The package contains an Android Studio project that demonstrates how to develop a simple online Snake game using Connection APIs.
5. [NearbySimpleconnection](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbySimpleconnection): The package contains an Android Studio project that demonstrates how to implement file sharing only by adding two lines of code.

## Precautions
The project contains multiple independent projects. After downloading code, you can open a project in Android Studio to build your app or add multiple apps to a project. You do not have to create a separate project for each app. You can open setting.gradle to select the project to build.
