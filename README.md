## Introduction
This sample code shows how to use APIs of Nearby Service. The project directory is as follows:

1. [NearbyStores](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyStores): provides an Android Studio demo project for beacon management.
2. [NearbyFileTransfer](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-nearby-demo/tree/master/NearbyFileTransfer): provides an Android Studio demo project that shows how to develop the file sharing function with only few lines of code.


## Precautions
The sample code contains multiple independent projects. After downloading the code, you can open a project in Android Studio to build a single app or add multiple apps to one project. You can specify the app to build in the **setting.gradle** file.
